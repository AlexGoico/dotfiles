My Compilation of Personal Dotfiles
===================================

Usage
-----
I simply symlink my configurations to the appropriate locations.
`ln -s /Users/alexgoico/cloned/dotfiles/.emacs.d/ /Users/alexgoico/.emacs.d`
If using this dotfile, your path will differ

There are better ways to doing this as detailed: [here](https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2016/02/best-way-to-store-dotfiles-git-bare-repo/). For now I'm keeping this as a todo item.

* **.bashrc** is my bash configuration file for my OSes.
* **.emacs.d** folder contains all my emacs configurations.
* **.vimrc** an exceedingly basic vim configuration file. 
  I use vim for simple configuration file edits on the terminal.
